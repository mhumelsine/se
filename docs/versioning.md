# Versioning 
- Follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).
- Development builds use the scheme `0.0.0-{yyyy.MM.dd}+{buildId}` ex: `0.0.0-2025.01.01+4501`
- Release builds use the scheme `{major}.{minor}.{patch}-{yyyy.MM.dd}+{buildId}` ex: `5.0.1-2025.02.12+3212`
- The build date and build Id allow teams to quickly check if newer builds have been published since QA was perfomred and to confirm the latest code is published.
