# Planning
We plan because later when we are in the weeds firefighting, we need to reference a rational mindset when we did not have the stress of the current situation and could think about the correct way to execute.

A good plan focuses on definition of success first, then the team will generate ideas and suggestions that meet the objective, finally selecting a set of concerete milestones that, if hit, will lead to success.  We need to plan a different levels of detail at times throughout a project.  

## Initial

### Listen

In the initial phase of a project, sales, project kickoff, we are focused on listening only.  Capturing what the client is asking for and why that is important to them.  We need to be able to repeat the problem back to the client and they agree euthusiasically.  If not, there may be details we are missing and they may be sayinh "yes" because they are tired of explaning, pay attention that you are getting commitment "yes" not agreement/passive "yes".

### Checkpoint
Leaving the initial phase, the team should have the following:
- A list of each business problem discovered and a decision of in/out of scope.
- A list of acceptance criteria - statements that can be proven true/false, that measure how successful the team was at addressing each business problem.

## Required Overhead

Does the project require weekly status reports, status meetings, written meeting minutes following meetings, periodic project management plan updates, customer code reviews, demos, incremental deployments, security scans, etc.?  We have to account for these and show the impact on the project.

### Project Management Reoccurring 
- Status meetings
- Status reports
- Meeting minutes/summaries
- Performance reviews
- Prioritize backlog
- Backlog grooming
- Sprint Review

### Project Management Ad-Hoc
- Access requests
- 

### Add Reoccurring to Backlog
- Add **Epic** for reoccurring project management tasks.
- Add **PBI** or **User Story** for each status report required at project start.

### Development Startup
- DevOps configuration for team process
- Provision dev, test, staging, and production environments
- Create the code repositories for the solution components.
- Setup CI/CD pipelines for each deployable artifact in the solution.  
- Configure branch policies to enforce minimum standards:
    - Pull request with minimum number of reviewers.
    - Squash merges into trunk branches.
    - Approval gates for elevated environments.
    - Who is allowed to bypass branch policies.
- Document naming standards for database, code, and other artifacts for brownfield projects.  For greenfield projects, use standards listed here.
